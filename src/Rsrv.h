/* Rserve communication is done over any reliable connection-oriented
   protocol (usually TCP/IP or local sockets). After the connection is
   established, the server sends 32 bytes of ID-string defining the
   capabilities of the server. Each attribute of the ID-string is 4 bytes
   long and is meant to be user-readable (i.e. don't use special characters),
   and it's a good idea to make "\r\n\r\n" the last attribute

   the ID string must be of the form:

   [0] "Rsrv" - R-server ID signature
   [4] "0100" - version of the R server
   [8] "QAP1" - protocol used for communication (here Quad Attributes Packets v1)
   [12] any additional attributes follow. \r\n<space> and '-' are ignored.

   optional attributes
   (in any order; it is legitimate to put dummy attributes, like "----" or
    "    " between attributes):

   "R151" - version of R (here 1.5.1)
   "ARpt" - authorization required (here "pt"=plain text, "uc"=unix crypt,
            "m5"=MD5)
            connection will be closed if the first packet is not CMD_login.
	    if more AR.. methods are specified, then client is free to
	    use the one he supports (usually the most secure)
   "K***" - key if encoded authentification is challenged (*** is the key)
            for unix crypt the first two letters of the key are the salt
	    required by the server */

/* QAP1 transport protocol header structure

   all int and double entries throughout the transfer are in
   Intel-endianess format: int=0x12345678 -> char[4]=(0x78,0x56,x34,0x12)
   functions/macros for converting from native to protocol format 
   are available below

   Please note also that all values muse be quad-aligned, i.e. the length
   must be divisible by 4. This is automatically assured for int/double etc.,
   but care must be taken when using strings and byte streams.
