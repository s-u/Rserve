Depends: R (>= 1.5.0)
Description: Rserve acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets) 
	     which allows binary requests to be sent to R. Every
	     connection has a separate workspace and working
	     directory. Client-side implementations are available
	     for popular languages such as C/C++ and Java, allowing
	     any application to use facilities of R without the need of
	     linking to R code. Rserve supports remote connection,
	     user authentication and file transfer.
